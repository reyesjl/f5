            <h2>5. Security</h2>
            <p>We take the security of your personal data seriously and implement various measures to protect it,
                including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We use Django’s built-in security features, including <strong>CSRF protection</strong> to prevent
                    cross-site request forgery, <strong>XSS prevention</strong> to protect against cross-site scripting
                    attacks, and strong session management.</li>
                <li>All user passwords are hashed securely, and we use Django's recommended password validators to
                    ensure strong passwords are used.</li>
                <li>Data transmission between our servers and your browser is encrypted using <strong>SSL/TLS
                        certificates</strong>.</li>
                <li>We regularly update our software and apply security patches to ensure that the platform is
                    safeguarded against known vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>We restrict access to personal information to authorized personnel only, who are required to treat
                    this information confidentially.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet is entirely secure, and while we strive to use
                commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

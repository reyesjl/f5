Welcome to the F5 Rugby project aka (First Five Rugby). This repo will hold all
the code for the new project. We will try to ship a new update every 3 weeks.
There will be an internal wiki for all information, discussions can be held 
there or here on github.

## Roadmap 

Summer of 2024 we are already hosting 3 in person camps. We plan to host more
community events. Such as camps, games, tournament sign ups, etc. Touch Rugby
is comething we also want to add to our website and platform.

- Events / Camps
- Blogs and news
- Health plans and sessions
- Team Tour service
- Team Kit service

## Events / Camps

This will hold all types of events. Including but not limited to First Five
Rugby Camps, or camps run by other individuals or organizations. There are
public guidelines for our events and users must adhere if they want to list
camps on our website. Featured camps will be our first priority. 

**General Events**
All events will work the same on our website. An event will have its own 
details page, as well as the required registration options if any exist, and
finally a payment gateway if the event is a paid event or requires tickets.
Events must meet the guidelines posted on our website for safety and liability
concerns.

**Rugby Camps**
This is what we 70% of our events will be and we plan to keep it as close to 
this number as possible. Ofcourse it is flexible and as events appear we will
do our best to balance and distribute them on our website. Rugby camps will
consist of coaches, multi day or single day as well as provide all their own
details, marketing, and payment requirments. F5 Rugby is not liable for 
any mishappenings while at these camps, though we do provide guidelines,
policies, and other safety measures which camps must adhere to in order to be
posted on our website.

**Featured Events**
Events that are of importance to the whole rugby community. For example: 
Cardiff Blues or other professional teams providing coaching to the local
area is deemed impotant for the rugby community. We want to promote those
over other events due to the quality of service and opportunity for us to
collaborate and learn from similar groups. Crusaders International Academy
is another group that has provided similar camps in the United States. MLR
teams or academy events, and others to be added in the future.

**Games**
We want to provide major games as well as tickets and registrations for these
types of events on our website. Our goal is to extend the reach, views, and 
engagement through the use of our site and community following.

## Blogs and News

This will be a short and simple section. We will try to cover some explorative
topics, low-key or unoticed news, along with some interesting and forward 
thinking rugby topics. 

**Coverage**
Our biggest goal and perhaps most interesting venture here is to centralize
the outlet of rugby news from different sectors of the United States Rugby
community. We will have sources for news in each state or region. Our goal
is to have atleast 10 sources by the end of 2024, and 50 by the end of 2025.

**Local News**
We want people on the East Coast to know and understand a bit of local rugby
from the West Coast, each team and club in the USA has its own history and 
story. We want our website to broadcast this in a way where anyone can find
out a little bit about a club or org in any part of the USA! 

## Health Plans

We aim to provide free and open source resources for all levels of the game
here. We want players to be able to find answers quickly, build a plan that
works for them and their goals. We want everyone to have the best guidance 
and direction, and access to whatever they need to be successful. 
We strive for this to be accurate and fill the needs of the rugby community.

**Public Plans**
These are accesssible plans built by professionals for the community. We 
have certified rugby trainers, strength coaches, and nutritionst helping.
We send out surveys, collect and publish data, and then build plans to 
support the community based on this data. Everything here is free. Always.

**Sessions**
If you want to create something more unique and tailored to you and your 
goals, we encourage users to book a session with an expert. Nutrition
or Strength, or Speed. Whatever you want or need, someone can help you.
We want everyone to have access to resources they need, and our site
is aiming to hire more and more coaches over the next year to ensure 
this need is met.

## Team Tour Service
This is an all inclusive rugby tour for your entire team. There is a limit
on the minimum number of players, it is 30! You can go on a tour to Ireland
and we plan to add other countries as we strengthen our international ties.

**Rugby**
Every tour includes local rugby activities. Specifically training with local
rugby teams and getting training from local coaches for your team! You can
also choose to have games and play against the local team if that is 
something you are interested in.

**Exclusive Tours**
Given our many years of doing rugby tours, we have established ties in these
countries. We have access to exclusive rugby games, behind the scenes looks,
and professional facility tours from clubs, organizations, and museums. We
can provide the absolute best connections.

**History**
All tours include history lessons from our bus drivers. They know the area
very well and have done this for over 10 years. They will give great city
knowledge, insight on historic places, and take you all over unique sights
and landmarks during your stay.

**Hotels**
Everything is taken care of for your team. We arrange your stays in various
hotels, hostels, and other locations during your whole stay. We know the best
locations and spots to sleep and arrange everything according to the desired
locations your team wants to visit. Each day there is something to do, and our
locations are crucial to enjoying the city life. Walkable town centers, as well
as restaurants, shops, and exclusive tours of facilities.

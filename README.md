# F5 Rugby Project (First Five Rugby)

Welcome to the F5 Rugby project, also known as First Five Rugby. This repository holds all the code for our new project, with updates planned every three weeks. We have an internal wiki for all information, and discussions can be held there or on GitHub.

## Roadmap

In the summer of 2024, we are hosting three in-person camps and plan to host more community events such as camps, games, tournament sign-ups, etc. We also want to add Touch Rugby to our website and platform.

### Key Initiatives:
- **Events / Camps**
- **Blogs and News**
- **Health Plans and Sessions**
- **Team Tour Service**
- **Team Kit Service**

## Events / Camps

### General Events

All events will have their own detail page, required registration options, and a payment gateway if necessary. Events must meet our guidelines for safety and liability concerns.

### Rugby Camps

Approximately 70% of our events will be rugby camps. These camps, run by coaches and organizations, will provide their own details, marketing, and payment requirements. F5 Rugby is not liable for incidents at these camps, though we provide guidelines, policies, and safety measures.

### Featured Events

We prioritize events that are important to the rugby community, such as coaching sessions by professional teams like Cardiff Blues and Crusaders International Academy. 

### Games

Our platform will provide access to major games, including ticket sales and registrations, to extend reach, views, and engagement.

## Blogs and News

We aim to cover explorative topics, unnoticed news, and interesting rugby developments.

### Coverage

Our goal is to centralize rugby news from various sectors of the U.S. rugby community. We aim to have at least 10 news sources by the end of 2024 and 50 by the end of 2025.

### Local News

We aim to broadcast stories from rugby clubs across the U.S., helping people understand the local rugby scenes from different regions.

## Health Plans

We provide free, open-source resources for all levels of the game, helping players find answers quickly and build effective plans.

### Public Plans

Professionals build these accessible plans for the community. We collect data through surveys and build plans based on this data, ensuring everything is free.

### Sessions

Users can book tailored sessions with experts in nutrition, strength, or speed. We aim to hire more coaches to meet the community's needs.

## Team Tour Service

We offer all-inclusive rugby tours for teams, with a minimum of 30 players. Initial tours include Ireland, with plans to add more countries.

### Rugby Activities

Tours include local rugby activities, training with local teams, and games against local teams if desired.

### Exclusive Tours

We offer exclusive access to rugby games, behind-the-scenes tours, and professional facilities due to our established international ties.

### History

Tours include history lessons from knowledgeable bus drivers who provide insights into historic places and landmarks.

### Hotels

We arrange stays in various accommodations, ensuring the best locations for enjoying city life and nearby amenities.

## Custom Kit Service

We provide custom STC branded rugby kits at competitive prices, handling everything in-house from design to delivery.

### Free Design

Teams receive a free design and 3D mockup with their colors, crest, and custom sponsors. All gear is sublimated and can be customized with player names and colors.

### Simple Process

Once the design is approved, we proceed with samples and further customization. Orders are shipped within 30 days, with prompt communication to address any needs.

## Conclusion

We aim to provide the highest quality in all our services, from accurate news to high-quality kits. Our goal is to grow positively and be the best in everything we do.
